            The Krishnagiri Reservoir Project (KRP) Dam, built across the Thenpennai (South Pennar) River near Dhuduganahalli in Krishnagiri district, Tamil Nadu, is a major irrigation and water-supply structure completed in 1957 during the Kamaraj era. Stretching nearly one kilometre in length, the dam was designed to store over 68 million cubic metres of water, which supports the irrigation of thousands of acres of farmland in and around Krishnagiri and also provides drinking water to nearby towns and villages. With its spillway gates, scenic reservoir, and the popular KRP Dam Park adjoining it, the dam serves both practical and recreational purposes, making it an essential landmark for the region’s agriculture, water management, and tourism.
