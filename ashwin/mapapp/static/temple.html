            The Krishnagiri Perumal Temple, also known as the Kalinga Narthana Perumal Temple, is a well-known and ancient Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu, located near the Krishnagiri Fort and close to the town’s central area. The temple is admired for its serene atmosphere, traditional Dravidian architectural style, and beautifully carved mandapams. The main deity, Lord Perumal, is worshipped in a graceful standing posture, and devotees believe the temple brings peace, prosperity, and protection. Situated on a small hillock, the temple offers a calm spiritual setting with views of the surrounding town and hills, making it both a devotional and scenic destination for visitors and pilgrims throughout the year.
