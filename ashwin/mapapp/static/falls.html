            Pikkanapalli (Bikkanapalli) Falls in Krishnagiri is a small but scenic natural waterfall located near Bikkanapalli village, surrounded by rocky hills, greenery, and a peaceful rural atmosphere. It is not a commercial tourist spot, which makes it a quiet place for nature lovers who enjoy short treks, photography, and spending time away from crowds. Water flow is usually seasonal, becoming fuller during the monsoon months, and visitors often appreciate the calm environment and natural beauty. However, the approach roads can be rough, and the water may sometimes get muddy during rains, so travellers are advised to visit with caution. Overall, Pikkanapalli Falls is a simple, serene getaway for those looking to explore Krishnagiri’s lesser-known natural spots.
